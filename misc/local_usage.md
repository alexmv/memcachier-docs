## Local usage

**IF(direct)**
To test against your application locally, you will need to run a local
memcached process. MemCachier is only available from the datacenter you signed
up for. But
**ENDIF**
**IF(heroku)**
To test your Heroku application locally, you will need to run a local
memcached server. MemCachier can only run in Heroku, but
**ENDIF**
because MemCachier and memcached speak the same protocol, you
shouldnâ€™t have any issues testing locally. Installation depends on your
platform.

**IF(direct)**
<p class="alert alert-info">
The below examples will install memcached without
SASL authentication support. This is generally what you want as client code can
still try to use SASL auth and memcached will simply ignore the requests which
is the same as allowing any credentials. So your client code can run without
modification locally.
