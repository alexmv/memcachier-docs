## Local usage

To test against your application locally, you will need to run a local
memcached process. MemCachier is only available from the datacenter you signed
up for. But because MemCachier and memcached speak the same protocol, you
shouldnâ€™t have any issues testing locally. Installation depends on your
platform.

<p class="alert alert-info">
The below examples will install memcached without
SASL authentication support. This is generally what you want as client code can
still try to use SASL auth and memcached will simply ignore the requests which
is the same as allowing any credentials. So your client code can run without
modification locally.

On Ubuntu:

```shell
$ sudo apt-get install memcached
```

Or on OS X (with Homebrew):

```shell
$ brew install memcached
```

Or for Windows please refer to [these
instructions](http://www.heckler.com.br/blog/2013/05/10/memcached-on-windows/)

For further information and resources (such as the memcached source code)
please refer to the [Memcache.org homepage](http://memcached.org)

To run memcached simply execute the following command:

```shell
$ memcached -v
```
