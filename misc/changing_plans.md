## Upgrading and downgrading

Changing your plan, either by upgrading or downgrading, requires no code
changes. Your cache won't be lost, either. Upgrading and downgrading Just
Worksâ„¢. Also, you are only ever charged by the hour for the time that you are
on a certain plan. So try experimenting with different cache sizes knowing that
you will only be charged for the hours you are on a plan, not for a whole
month.

Changing your plan, either by upgrading or downgrading, can be done easily at
any time through your

<strong>*</strong> When moving between the development plan to a
production plan, you <strong>will</strong> loose your cache. This is
unavoidable due to the strong separation between the development and
production clusters.
