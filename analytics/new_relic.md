## New Relic integration

MemCachier supports integration with your New Relic dashboard if you
happen to be a customer of both MemCachier and New Relic. Currently
this feature is only available to caches of *500MB* or larger. A blog
post showing the integration can be found
[here](http://blog.memcachier.com/2014/03/05/memcachier-and-new-relic-together/).

To setup the integration you will need to find your New Relic license key. This
can be done by going to your "Account Settings" page when logged in to New
Relic by click on your New Relic username in the top right corner. Then you
will find your license key in the right side information column. It should be
exactly 40 characters long. Please refer to the [blog
post](http://blog.memcachier.com/2014/03/05/memcachier-and-new-relic-together/)
for a visual walkthrough.

Once you have your New Relic licence key, it can be entered for your cache on
the analytics dashboard page. In the bottom right corner there is a button to
do this.
