Here we explain how you setup and install MemCachier with Python.

MemCachier has been tested with the `pylibmc` memcache client. This
client relies on the C libmemcached library. This should be fairly
straight-forward to install with your package manager on Linux or
Windows. We also have a
[blog post](http://blog.memcachier.com/2014/11/05/ubuntu-libmemcached-and-sasl-support/)
for Ubuntu users on how to do this.
**IF(heroku)**
You only need to be concerned about this for local development, the Heroku
platform includes `libmemcached`.
**ENDIF**

Once it's installed, then install `pylibmc`:

```term
$ pip install pylibmc
```

Be sure to update your `requirements.txt` file with these new requirements
(note that your versions may differ than whatâ€™s below):

```text
pylibmc==1.5.1
```

**IF(direct)**
<p class="alert alert-info">
<b>Heroku Users:</b> The above <code>pylibmc</code> requirements must be added
directly to your <code>requirements.txt</code> file. They shouldn't be placed
in an included pip requirement file. The Heroku Python buildpack checks the
<code>requirements.txt</code> file and only that file for the presence of
<code>pylibmc</code> to trigger bootstrapping <code>libmemcached</code>, which
is prerequisite for installing <code>pylibmc</code>.

Next, configure your settings.py file the following way:

```python
import pylibmc

servers = os.environ.get('MEMCACHIER_SERVERS', '').split(',')
user = os.environ.get('MEMCACHIER_USERNAME', '')
pass = os.environ.get('MEMCACHIER_PASSWORD', '')

mc = pylibmc.Client(servers, binary=True,
                    username=user, password=pass,
                    behaviors={
                      # Faster IO
                      "tcp_nodelay": True,

                      # Keep connection alive
                      'tcp_keepalive': True,

                      # Timeout for set/get requests
                      'connect_timeout': 2000, # ms
                      'send_timeout': 750 * 1000, # us
                      'receive_timeout': 750 * 1000, # us
                      '_poll_timeout': 2000, # ms

                      # Better failover
                      'ketama': True,
                      'remove_failed': 1,
                      'retry_timeout': 2,
                      'dead_timeout': 30,
                    })
```

After this, you can start writing cache code in your Python app:

```python
mc.set("foo", "bar")
print mc.get("foo")
```

**IF(direct)**
<p class="alert alert-info">
A confusing error message you may get from <code>pylibmc</code> is
