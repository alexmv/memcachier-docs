<h2 id="wordpress">WordPress</h2>

We support WordPress through two different options. The first you can find
[here](https://github.com/memcachier/wordpress-cache), and uses the binary
memcache protocol and is supported by us. It should be easy to install, simply
follow the instructions on the Git repo.

We also have a community support alternative approach that uses the ASCII
memcache protocol, which is far easier to get running on your own servers if
you aren't using a hosted platform like Heroku. You can find it on GitHub
[here](https://github.com/hubertnguyen/memcachier). Please follow the
instructions on the repo page.
